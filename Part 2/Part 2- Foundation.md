# Part 2: Foundation

_“I am very aware that the original concept must do something worthwhile creatively or all the hard work to follow will be wasted.” — Mary Blair_

It was 2002 at the SXSW Interactive festival in Austin. I had registered my domain name manton.org a few years earlier, and used it for some project pages and even a [niche link blog on animation][1] as early as 1999, but I had never dedicated the whole site to a personal blog. What I saw at SXSW was the inspiration I needed to start blogging.

My first post, in its entirety:

> SXSW Interactive started today. Seems an appropriate time to start a weblog, as if there weren’t enough in the world already. Welcome, and enjoy.

In hindsight, this first post illustrated two things: first, it was actually a microblog post, at only 145 characters and no title; and second, I thought I was _late_ to blogging. I thought there might already be too many blogs. Now, 20 years later, my blog is older than only a handful of the hundreds that I read regularly.

There weren't enough blogs back in 2002, and there aren't enough now. I have no doubt that some of the blogs created today will be important in the years ahead, maybe contributing to a debate on politics, or showcasing new writing or art, or serving as an archive that reflects today's culture.

Personal blogs are _independent_ by default. They are separate from any one platform. In 2002 if I had instead chosen to put all my writing into early social networks like Friendster or MySpace, which launched a year later in 2003, I wouldn't have much to show for it now.

My blog is one of the most important things I do. It's not my full-time job. It doesn't make any money directly. But consistently writing, collecting a memory of those everyday events, adding my own commentary on technology, or chronicling the projects I work on — it becomes a substantial archive over time.
